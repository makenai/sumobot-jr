# Sumobot Jr.

Sumobot Jr. is an open source sumobot design made for [Nodebots Day](http://nodebotsday.com). Most existing sumo kits cost between $99 and $160. Since we're trying to keep our event costs down, I decided to try to design a bot that could be put together for around $50 including the cost of the Arduino. The name and design are inspired by the simplicity and zip-tied wooden beauty of the [Printrbot Jr](http://printrbot.com/).

## How?

The main part of the design is a cutting sheet in EPS file format that is designed to be used with a laser cutter. You can find it in the cutting_plans directory. If you don't have a laser cutter, you can use a CNC, tape your printout to balsa wood and go at it with an x-acto knife, or send it to a laser cutting service like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) and get the sheet done for about $10.

There is also a directory called 3d_print that contains an STL file for a ball caster designed by [sliptonic](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13782) - the STL is set up for a 16mm ball bearing, but you can make one for other sizes with the included OpenSCAD file.

## What if I don't have a Laser Cutter / 3D Printer?!

Neither do I! The best way to get some help creating the parts is to look up your local [Hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org) and connect with them. I belong to a fantastic hackerspace in Las Vegas called [SYN Shop](http://synshop.org)!

If you don't have a hackerspace nearby, you can also use a mail order service like [Ponoko](http://ponoko.com) that does both 3D printing and laser cutting.

## Other Parts Needed

+ Arduino - $25
+ [4xAA battery holder](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1153) - $2
+ 2 Zip ties - ?
+ 5 \#4 3/8" wood screws - ?
+ Thick rubber bands - ?
+ 2 continuous servo motors like [Futaba S148](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/536) - $28
+ Some wire or leads
+ 16mm ball bearing - ?

That's about it! Connect the red and black leads on the servos together, then connect them to the + and - terminals on the battery holder respectively. Then connect the black leads and - terminal to the ground of the Arduino. Finally, the white leads of each motor go to pins 9 and 10 (or whatever you lke) on the Arduino - you're done!

Stay tuned for detailed assembly instructions.
